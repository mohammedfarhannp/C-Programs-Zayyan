# 💻 C Programs Collection

A collection of various C programs written for learning, practice, and reference.  
This repository includes examples ranging from beginner-friendly basics to more advanced concepts such as data structures, algorithms, file handling, and system programming.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each program is organized into its own folder or grouped by topic:

```

/basics/        → Simple C programs (I/O, loops, functions, arrays, strings)
/algorithms/    → Sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.
/data_structures/ → Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs
/file_handling/ → File operations (read/write), text/binary files
/system/        → System calls, processes, memory, OS-related programs
/misc/          → Other programs and experiments
